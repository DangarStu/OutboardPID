# Cooling water pump PID controller

This project contains ESP32 code for sensing the temperature of a cooling system and driving an electric water pump at whatever speed is required to keep the engine at the specified temperature.
This project is built from the template for [SensESP](https://github.com/SignalK/SensESP/).
